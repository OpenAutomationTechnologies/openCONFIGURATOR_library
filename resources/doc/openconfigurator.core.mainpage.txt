\subsection about About
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openconf/">openCONFIGURATOR</a> is an open-source configuration tool for easy setup, configuration and maintenance of any POWERLINK network.
It ideally complements <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpowerlink/">openPOWERLINK</a>, the open source POWERLINK protocol stack for master and slave.
The library produces four files which can be used by the openPOWERLINK stack and application:

* `mnobd.cdc`

  This file is used to configure the MN stack. It includes all
  configuration data of the MN and all CNs including the network mapping
  information. CN configuration is handled by the configuration manager (CFM)
  module of the MN.

* `mnobd.txt`

  This file describes the stack configuration in human-readable format. It
  includes all configuration data of the MN and all CNs including the network
  mapping information. This file is provided for diagnostic purposes only.

* `mnobd_char.txt`

  This file describes the stack configuration hexadecimal format for targets
  with no operating system.

* `xap.xml`

  The xml file contains the structure definition of the process image. It
  depends on the available data fields of the CNs used in the application. The
  application can parse the xml file and therefore get information about the
  mapped channel offsets within the process image.

* `xap.h`

  The header file contains structure definition of the process image in the
  form of two ANSI C structures. It can be directly included in an application
  such as the openPOWERLINK stack demos.

* `ProcessImage.cs`

  The header file contains structure definition of the process image in the
  form of two C# structures.

\subsection req Building requirements
1. External tools needed:
	- CMAKE - 2.8.12 or higher - (http://www.cmake.org/)
	- Doxygen - 1.8.5 or higher - (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) (required for documentation build)
	- Swig - 3.0.3 or higher - (http://www.swig.org/) (required for wrapper build)
	- Java JDK - 1.7.0.75 or higher - (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) (required for Java wrapper build)

2. External libraries needed:
	- BOOST C++ libraries (log, date_time, filesystem, system, thread, atomic, chrono) - 1.58.0 (prefered) or higher - (http://www.boost.org/)

\subsection build Building process
1. Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openconf/">openCONFIGURATOR</a> source code
2. Open CMAKE and choose a toolchain (Tested: Visual Studio 11 (minimum required or higher), Unix Makefiles (GCC 4.8.3 or higher)
3. Choose the %openCONFIGURATOR root directory as source directory and a custom build directory.
4. After the CMAKE configuration additional build options are available:
	- OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_CORE_DOCUMENTATION (adds documentation target to build)
	- OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_CORE_JAVA_WRAPPER (adds Java wrapper target and Java demo application to build)
	- OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_CORE_JAVA_WRAPPER_DEBUG_INFO (if OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_CORE_JAVA_WRAPPER is chosen) (adds debug information to the Java wrapper target JAR file)
	- OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_CORE_NET_APP (if OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_NET_WRAPPER is chosen) (adds .NET commandline demo application target to build)
	- OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_CORE_NET_WRAPPER (adds .NET wrapper target to build)
	- OPEN_CONFIGURATOR_CORE_UNIT_TESTS (adds unit test target to build)
5. After the configuration process the toolchain files are generated by CMAKE.
6. Build the library and specified targets with the toolchain.
